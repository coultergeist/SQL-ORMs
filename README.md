# SQL-ORMs
Lab: What is an ORM and create ~20 different fields stored in a DB

What is ORM. According to Wiki: "Object Relational Mapping is used to convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database." I interpret ORM as a sort of Biological Speicies ID, "Taxonomic rank." Species, Genus, Family, etc. So to say that identifing different characteristics of each "object" will classify them. An object is anything. In class we used "human" as an object. Human, female, 36 yr. old. 

ORM mapping software. There's a bunch: Phython, Ruby, C++, Flex, Java, PHP. These are all examples of "software framework." Which of these are used is based on the software you are using or the results you'd like to achieve. This is something that should be easily answered either in a "yes/no" format or with a simply drop down menu, ie: education: GED, HS Dipolma, AS, BS, etc.)

~20 different data types (or values) one may track within a SQL.
